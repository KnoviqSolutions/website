        <p class="lead"> The retail industry has been affected by many states who have implemented stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services Report provided by the U.S. Census bureau, there was a decrease of 8.7% in retail sales from February to March 2020.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Additionally shoppers are demonstrating more thoughtful and deliberate behaviors while still relying on their trusted brands. However even with the decrease of retail sales, shoppers are still shopping and ready to demonstrate loyalty. According to Path to Purchase Institute, "retailers and brands should think twice before abandoning all promotional activity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, because many shoppers are still looking for deals as they stock up for an uncertain future." Even though sales have significantly gone done, brands should take note of the consumer still willing to spend on the things that are of essential value at the moment. Providing limited offers or discounts could be key to acquiring additional sales.</p>

        <p class="lead">Food & Beverage saw a surge as many people prepared to be home and cook as Dine In restaurants close due to stay-at-home orders. Shoppers are being more intentional with meal planning before ordering grocery online or for home delivery, resorting in a surge in grocery e-commerce.</p>

        <p class="lead">Clothing saw a decline as many of the shopping center have closed due to social distancing. However, EnsembleIQ found that 21% of shoppers are now shopping online retailers as a result of COVID-19, while 26% reported they don't typically shop online retailers. </p>

        <h2><strong><u>Knoviq's Actionable Insights</u></strong></h1>
        <p class="lead">Having an online presence has been a strong factor during this pandemic. Statista conducted a survey to understand customer's online behavior for certain products and services.</p>

        <p class="lead">Our key takeaways for your business to remain successful during this:
          <li class="lead"><strong> Adapt to a Digital Retail Experience.</strong>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-left:40px">Customer's need a digital, at-home, and low-touch option while navigating the pandemic safely. Establishing a digital experience for your retail services gives a strong advantage within the market. For some businesses, the development of digital functionalities is vital to ensuring 'continuity of services'. Leveraging 'Do It At Home' opportunities increase page views and transactions in an expedited timeframe. Educational retail services for example have accelerated digital value-added services to help keep the lights on for many vendors. </p></li>

            <li class="lead"><strong> Digital Delivery Has Stimulated Sales Transactions</strong>
              <p class="lead" style="margin-left:40px">With stay at home orders in place, digital delivery has become a necessity for most customers and the frictionless services are bound to stick around longer after the pandemic has been stabled. Leveraging third party delivery services are viable options to help your customer's shop their favorite brands and most of all remain safe. Vendors such as Shipt and Instacart have seen grocery orders increase between 124% and 218% according to Big Commerce.
              Additionally, analysis has demonstrated a surge in BOPIS and curbside services. Vendors such as Dick's Sporting Goods have leveraged their 'buy online, pick up in store' services and are seeing positive improvements during the pandemic. </p>

            <li class="lead"><strong>During Uncertain Times, Meaningful Insights Are More Critical</strong>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-left:40px"> Maneurvering through a pandemic or any crisis leaves businesses with a stream of unknowns. During this time, it is important to ensure you are comfortable making decisions in the context of uncertainty. With COVID-19, initially many almost knew nothing that they needed to know in order to manage it efficiently. And there still remains a series of questions, however each step of the way you should have the insights to best assess risk and plan in the moment of real uncertain circumstances. Having insights helps businesses to shift priorities in response to being prepared for emergencies as well as taking in new consumer trends and behaviors. Consider whether or not your business has the tools and data to handle tough questions for sticky situations as right now.
